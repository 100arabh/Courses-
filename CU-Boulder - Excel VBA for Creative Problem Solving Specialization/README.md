#### Instructors: Charlie Nuttelman

This Specialization is for learners wishing to dramatically change the way that they use Excel spreadsheets by unleashing the power to automate and optimize spreadsheets using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). The first two courses will teach learners the basics of VBA through the use of dozens of educational screencasts and a series of quizzes and in-application programming assignments. Finally, in Part 3 of the course, learners will complete 3 "real world" and somewhat open ended projects, which are graded through peer review.

Applied Learning Project
Learners will implement and apply predictive, classification, clustering, and information retrieval machine learning algorithms to real datasets throughout each course in the specialization. They will walk away with applied machine learning and Python programming experience.
