#### Instructors: Charlie Nuttelman

"Excel/VBA for Creative Problem Solving, Part 1" is aimed at learners who are seeking to augment, expand, optimize, and increase the efficiency of their Excel spreadsheet skills by tapping into the powerful programming, automation, and customization capabilities available with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).


## Syllabus

### Macro recording, VBA procedures, and debugging
- Week 1 will introduce you to visual basic for applications (VBA) and teach you the foundational tools required to create basic procedures in VBA. You'll learn about different data types and the scope of variables, how to troubleshoot your code when it's not working, and how to record basic macros using both absolute and relative referencing modes.

### User-Defined VBA Functions
- In Week 2, you will learn basic VBA expression entry, how to create user-defined functions, how to convert functions to Add-Ins in Excel, how to borrow Excel's built-in functions, how to troubleshoot your VBA functions when they aren't working, and you'll learn about how to design your procedures in a modular fashion.

### Exchanging Information Between Excel and VBA
- Week 3 teaches you all about how to reference and move information to VBA from Excel and vice versa. You'll learn about the various objects, properties, methods, and events in VBA. Some of the most important properties and methods will be learned in this module that will make future problem solving in the course possible. You will also learn how to deal with errors that arise in your subroutines.

### Programming structures in VBA
- Week 4 begins the "meat" of programming in VBA, and we are finally moving into some exciting problem solving. You will learn about the common programming structures in VBA (sequence, selection, and repetition) that form the foundation for advanced programming procedures. Several examples will highlight the utility of these programming structures.

### Numerical techniques and live solution strategies
- Those who complete the Week 5 assessments (Quiz 5 and Assignment 5) will earn an Honors designation on their Course Certificate (see the first reading "WEEK 5 IS OPTIONAL" below). Week 5 delves into some important numerical techniques that can be used in Excel without the use of VBA. You will also explore ways in which the targeting tools in Excel (Goal Seek and Solver tools) can be automated in VBA. Finally, you'll explore some exciting "live solution" methods that have distinct advantages, especially for case studies where you have multiple scenarios that must be solved. Week 5 represents the most math-heavy module of either part of "Excel/VBA for Creative Problem Solving" but will provide you with some extremely useful tools that you can implement in solving a variety of real world problems. Even if you choose to skip/forego Week 5, you can always use this material as reference in the future!
